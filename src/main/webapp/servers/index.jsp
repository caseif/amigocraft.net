<b>Survival</b>
<br>
Our survival server is a bit like vanilla Minecraft, but we've got a few goodies installed as well. Installed plugins include <a
		href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/essentials">Essentials</a>, <a
		href="http://wiki.ess3.net/wiki/Group_Manager">GroupManager</a>, <a
		href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/goldbank">GoldBank</a> (our own economy plugin), <a
		href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/lwc">LWC</a>, and <a
		href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/worldguard">WorldGuard</a>. There are plenty of other small ones designed to make your experience all the more enjoyable. So join now, at <span

<b>Minigame</b>
<br>
Our minigame server hasn't launched yet, but it'll be ready in the coming months. When it launches, it probably won't have more than a couple games, but you'll have the opportunity to watch it grow as we add more and more ways to play. It will serve as the official server for a plugin of ours called <a
		href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ttt">TTT</a>, and possibly others which haven't been created yet. It will also feature exclusive maps (which is what we're working on now) and a rather fantastic lobby, if we do say so ourselves. ;) It will be found at <span
		style="color:red">to be announced</span>.
