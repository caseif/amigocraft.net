<i>Your server is laggy!</i>
<br>
Our server is currently hosted on a machine with multiple Xeon processors and at least 6 GB of RAM at any given time (more is allocated if necessary), so any lag you experience is likely client-side or the result of a poor connection.
<br><br>
<i>Your server is down!</i>
<br>
If the server goes down, it's likely due to us testing something, and will be up again within minutes. Our host advertises 99.9% uptime, so if it does go down without us knowing, it should still be up again within minutes.
<br><br>
<i>I've been banned, but I want to keep playing on your server! May I appeal?</i>
<br>
Certainly. There's a section called "Ban Appeals" in the forums, which you may post to if you've been banned. Please know that creating an appeal does not necessarily mean you will be unbanned; it's there as a way for wrongly banned players to reverse the ban. If you were banned for something like advertisement or minor spamming or griefing, there's a good chance your appeal will be successful. But, if you take out, say, an entire house, you most likely will not be rejoining the server any time soon.

<i>How can I donate?</i>
<br>
Click that "Donate" link at the top of the page. He's a nice guy; he'll tell you all about it.
